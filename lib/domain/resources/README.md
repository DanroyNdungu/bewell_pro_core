# Resources

This directory should hold objects that may be used for IO processes.

These objects may be defined as `enums` or `class`

By defining them here, we slowly migrate from using `Map<String,dynamic>` especially for processes that

we control and have domain knowledge about.

Example:

- Login inputs/outputs
- Signup inputs/outputs
